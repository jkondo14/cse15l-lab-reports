Hi, when testing the Java File ArrayExamples.java with the bash script, test.sh, I continuously run into failures and never get the answer correctly. I believe my test input and expectations are correct as they are in reverse order. I am wondering what about ArrayExamples.java, in particular the reversed function, which may be incorrect as I am not sure what the problem may be.

Hello there. Read the instructions clearly as it states to return a new array and when transferring that for loop, what would happen if the array is pulling the values from the same array.

## Part 2 - Reflection
In CSE 15L, I learned a lot about bash scripts and the usefulness of the terminal as I hardly used the terminal for coding before, except for downloading Python 3 using pip3. I learned the
various commands such as cd, ls, and cat, and enjoyed creating bash scripts to allow for the recycling of code and the functionality of bash scripts. This class taught me how to create a GitHub
Page and Markdown, things many classes will never teach, and the functions of GitHub, like committing and forking and pushing changes as I always have wondered how GitHub changes were made.
I would like to take this time and thank Professor Joe for his constant support and empathy towards his students and congratulate him on his second child as it is a very important and beautiful
moment of life. I would like to also thank the TAs and tutors for their continuous patience and guidance to us, students, as we were lost on various parts of this class during labs and they truly
showed a helping hand with a smile!
